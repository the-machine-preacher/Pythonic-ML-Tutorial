    "Computers have been designed to excel at number-crunching tasks, something that most humans find terrifying. On the other hand, humans are naturally wired to effortlessly recognize objects and patterns, something that computers find difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>This juxtaposition brought up two important questions in the 1950s:\n",
    "- “How can computers be better at solving problems that humans find effortless?”\n",
    "- “How can computers solve such problems in the way a human brain does?”\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>In 1957, [Frank Rosenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt) explored the second question and invented the *Perceptron algorithm* that allowed an artificial neuron to simulate a biological neuron! The artificial neuron could take in an input, process it based on some rules, and fire a result. But computers had been doing this for years — what was so remarkable?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/perceptron.webp\" style=\"width:500px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a final step in the Perceptron algorithm that would give rise to the incredibly mysterious world of Neural Networks — *the artificial neuron could train itself based on its own results, and fire better results in the future.* In other words, it could learn by trial and error, just like a biological neuron."

However, as it turns out, this wasn’t enough to solve a wide range of problems, and interest in the Perceptron Algorithm along with Neural Networks waned for many years.\n",

    "<br/>It was found out that creating multiple layers of neurons — with one layer feeding its output to the next layer as input — could process a wide range of inputs, make complex decisions, and still produce meaningful results. With some tweaks, the algorithm became known as the *Multilayer Perceptron,* which led to the rise of *Feedforward Neural Networks.*"
