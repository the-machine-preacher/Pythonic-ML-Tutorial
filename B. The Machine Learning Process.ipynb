When we’re thinking about creating a model, we have to narrow down to one measurable, specific task. For example, we might say we want to predict the wait times for customers’ food orders within 2 minutes, so that we can give them an accurate time estimate."

    "Arguably the largest chunk of time in any machine learning process is finding the relevant data to help answer your question, and getting it into the format necessary for performing predictive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>We know that for supervised learning, we need labeled datasets, or datasets that have clear labels of what their ground truth is. For an example like the restaurant wait time, this would mean we would need many examples of past orders, tagged with how long the wait time was. Maybe the restaurant already tracks this data, but we might need to augment the data collection with a timer that starts when the customer orders, stops when the customer receives their food, and records that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>Creating this system of recording data, as well as gathering enough data to be able to train our model will take time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>Once you have your data, you want to understand it so that you will know what model to apply and what the outputs will mean. First, you will want to examine the summary statistics:\n",

    "- Calculate percentiles\n",
    "- Find correlations that indicate relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>You may also want to visualize the data, perhaps using box plots to identify outliers, histograms to show the basic structure of the data, and scatter plots to examine relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>Let’s say we’re examining the existing distribution of wait times. We see that the overall average is 6.25 minutes per order. But we also produce this histogram: \n",
    "<img src=\"Images\\waittime_hist.webp\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>We might glean from this that there are two main groups of orders. One group seems to cluster around 4 minutes, while another, smaller, group seems to cluster around 11 mins. We could use this to modify our question and build a model that will classify whether or not an order will be in this “short” timeframe, or in the “long” timeframe. Is it dependent on the food that it ordered? The time of day of the order?\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>Perhaps we just become aware of the bimodality of our data. If our model consistently predicts a wait time of around 6 or 7 minutes, then we are not taking into account the true structure of our data."

We use different models on categorical and numerical data, and different models on datasets with many features and datasets with few features. Our models also have different levels of interpretability — how easy is it for us to see what these results mean and what led to them? When we teach the models, we will discuss the tradeoffs of using each one."
